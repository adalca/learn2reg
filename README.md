# Overview

Medical image registration has been a cornerstone in the research fields of medical image computing and computer assisted intervention, responsible for many clinical applications. Whilst machine learning methods have long been important in developing pairwise algorithms, recently proposed deep-learning-based frameworks directly infer displacement fields without iterative optimisation for unseen image pairs, using neural networks trained from large population data. These novel approaches promise to tackle several most challenging aspects previously faced by classical pairwise methods, such as high computational cost, robustness for generalisation and lack of inter-modality similarity measures. Output from several international research groups working in this area include award-winning conference presentations, high-impact journal publications, well-received open-source implementations and industrial-partnered translational projects, generating significant interests to all levels of world-wide researchers. Accessing to the experience and expertise in this inherently multidisciplinary topic can be beneficial to many in our community, especially for the next generation of young scientists, engineers and clinicians who often have only been exposed to a subset of these methodologies and applications. We propose to organise a tutorial including both theoretical and practical sessions, inviting expert lectures and tutoring coding for real-world examples. Six lectures cover topics from basic methodologies to advanced research directions, with two hands-on sessions guiding participants to understand and implement published algorithms using clinical imaging data. We aim to provide an opportunity for the participants to bridge the gap between expertises in medical image registration and deep learning, as well as to start a forum to discuss know-hows, challenges and future opportunities in this area.
